A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is a subset of a graph that connects all the nodes together with the **least total edge weight** and **without forming any cycles**. It always has **V-1 edges** if the graph has V vertices. MST cannot be formed if the graph is disconnected because some nodes cannot be reached. If you **add an edge** to an MST, it will create a cycle, and if you **remove an edge**, the graph will become disconnected. In a **complete graph**, every node is connected to every other node, so it is always possible to create an MST. The MST in a complete graph will include only the **minimum number of edges needed to connect all nodes** without cycles, ignoring the unnecessary extra edges. MST can be used in network design, circuit design, and any problem where we want to **connect all points efficiently** with minimal cost.
complete indirected graph can have n^(n-2) number of spanning trees
from a complete graph by removing maximum e-n+1 edges we can construct a spanning tree..
